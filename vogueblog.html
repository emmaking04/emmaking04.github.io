               Hello! Welcome to the first ever Vogue Blog! At Vogue Chic, you will be able to buy chic makeup. All of my items are very high-end, but they are super affordable. Everything is made in the U.S.A. At this moment right not, the nation is shutting all of the stores down due to the Corona Virus. I created this shop so that you all will still be able to buy my items from the safety of your homes. Remember, this is a very serious epidemic, and you should be taking this super seriously. My team and I are taking extra precautions in mailing your orders out to you. Please, leave you packages out in your garages for 24 hours before bringing it inside just to be save! My team and I our praying for everything to be able to go back to normal soon! In the mean time,I hope you enjoy my shop!

               Grab her feet. (Marty does, and they put Jennifer down by the discarded laser discs.) OK, now what? In exactly 2 minutes, you go round the corner into the Café 80's. Cafe 80's?(Street) (w.t) Right Doc, let's get our asses back to the future... (Lightning strikes, bringing down a tree.) Doc, Doc, are you OK? (DeLorean) (w.t) That was a close one Marty, I almost bought the farm! (Street)Ahh!! We got ourselves a new courthouse...high time we had a hangin'! Oh, oh God, hu... (Tannen tightens the noose around Marty's neck and they hoist him up so that he is hanging from the rope with his feet dangling. Tannen and his gang are enjoying this. From a short distance away a man steps into view. We only see that he is wearing boots and a long coat. He holds a long gun in his hand. Neither the gang or Marty have seen him yet.) Haven't had a hanging in a long time!

               (Freezes in place) You mean we're out of gas? (still casual) Yeah, no big deal, we got Mr. Fusion, right? Mr. Fusion powers the time circuits and the flux capacitor. But the internal combustion engine runs on ordinary gasoline; it always has. There's not going to be a gas station around here until some time in the next century. Without gasoline, we can't get the Delorean up to 88 miles per hour. So what'll we do? (Open Plain)Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance. (Lunchroom) (Marty sits down across from George at a table. George is writing in a notebook.) George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Loraine. What are you writing? Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.Let me go! Sonny, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. (3-D hits Marty on the head and Marty passes out. As the screen fades to black we can hear “The easy way” quietly.) (Pleasure Paradise – 27th Floor) (Marty wakes up in a bed. He wakes up a bit and sees his mother Lorraine.)

               (stops and turns back.) Oh, her name's Miss Clayton. Clara Clayton. (Doc looks up in shock. Marty is surprised as well. The Mayor leaves.) Well, Doc, now we know who Clara is. Marty. It's impossible. The idea that I could fall in love at first sight? It's romantic nonsense. There's no scientific rationale to that. Laughing. C'mon, Doc, it's not science. You meet the right girl, it just hits ya; it's like lightning.(v.o) Don't worry, the book is on Biff's dashboard. (Biff’s Car) (The car has just left the tunnel.) (w.t) I'll grab it as soon as we get to the school. (Courthouse Square)(Marty looks at the paper again.) Hey Doc, this date...wait, this is tomorrow's newspaper! Precisely! I already went further ahead into time to see what else happens. I backtracked everything to this one event, that's why we're here today to prevent this incident from ever happening. (His watch beeps.) Blank, I'm late! Wait a minute, where are you going now? To intercept the real Marty Junior, you're taking his place. Round the corner at the Café 80's, guy named Griff, just say no!(Clara manages to get off her horse and onto the end of the train.) (into walkie-talkie) Hey, Doc, we just hit 35! (into walkie-talkie) Okay, Marty, I'm coming aboard! (He begins to climb out to the Delorean) Emmett!
