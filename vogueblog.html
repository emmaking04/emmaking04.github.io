               (Closet) (Jennifer, still hiding in the closet, listens to them.) (o.s) Your father's biggest problem Marlene is that he loses all self control when someone calls him chicken. How many times have we heard it George? (Kitchen) Mom...(School Parking Lot) (Marty and Lorraine arrive at the dance. Marty's very nervous.) Do you mind if we park for a while? That's a great idea. I'd love to park. Huh?Certainty in his voice. Sarsaparilla. Whiskey, Chester. Whiskey? Emmett, are you sure? You know what happened to you on the fourth of July... Whiskey. (takes out a bottle) Okay, I ain't your papa. (He pours some in a small shot glass.) I just don't wanna see you...losing the whole thing.(Biffâ€™s Car) (w.t) Doc! (The car enters the tunnel, meaning the radio and the walkie-talkies are cut off temporally.) (Courthouse Square) (w.t) Marty? (normally) Oh my...(We see what Doc has spotted. It's the DeLorean from Part 1 under the covers! Doc goes over to it.) Great Scott! (He lifts up the covers and peers in.) Oh my God.Stand back! (to his boys as the doors close) All right, boys, buckle up! Hey, Doc...where ya goin' now? Back to the future? From the cab window, he shakes his head. Nope. Already been there! (he waves at Marty and Jennifer) (Marty and Jennifer wave back, and the time train rises into the air and suddenly gains speed and disappears. The screen blackens and we see...THE END.)

               Ya! Ya! 24! It's no use Marty! Even the fastest horse in the world can't run more than 35, 40 miles an hour. Ya! Ya! Ya! (Blacksmith Shop) (Marty is trying to start the Delorean while Doc pours some type of alcohol into the tank.)(The cafe doors open and Griff enters. Griff is Biff's grandson, and he's even meaner than Biff was in 1955. Griff is wearing tough-guy clothes and a grey, metallic hat.) Hey Gramps, I told you 2 coats of wax on my car, not just 1. (gets up) Hey, hey, I just put the 2nd coat on last week. Yeah, with your eyes closed? Are you two related? What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. (Marty leans down to talk to Joey.) So you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid. Yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.Who the  is John F. Kennedy? Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughtta spend the night? After all, Dad almost killed him with the car. That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Well gee, I don't know. And he could sleep in my room. (she grabs Marty's thigh under the table.)How the hell'd he change his clothes so fast? (o.s) ...an oldie where I come from. (to Starlighters) All right guys, it's a blues riff in B, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, OK? (Biff's gang goes up to the side of the stage as 1955 Marty starts to play. They're there waiting for him to finish the song before they nail him. Only 1985 Marty sees them. He gets out his walkie-talkie.) (w.t) Doc! (DeLorean)
