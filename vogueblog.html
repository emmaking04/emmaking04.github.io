               Hello! Welcome to the first ever Vogue Blog! At Vogue Chic, you will be able to buy chic makeup. All of my items are very high-end, but they are super affordable. Everything is made in the U.S.A. At this moment right not, the nation is shutting all of the stores down due to the Corona Virus. I created this shop so that you all will still be able to buy my items from the safety of your homes. Remember, this is a very serious epidemic, and you should be taking this super seriously. My team and I are taking extra precautions in mailing your orders out to you. Please, leave you packages out in your garages for 24 hours before bringing it inside just to be save! My team and I our praying for everything to be able to go back to normal soon! In the mean time,I hope you enjoy my shop!
